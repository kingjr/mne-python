{
  "stim_chs": "Define the channels that are used to generate events. If the field is empty, the default channels are used (for NYU systems only). Channels can be defined as comma separated channel numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), ranges (1:7) and combinations of the two (1:4, 7, 10:13).",
  "stim_coding": "Specifies how stim-channel events are translated into trigger values. Little- and big-endian assume binary coding. In little-endian order, the first channel is assigned the smallest value (1) and the last channel is assigned the highest value (with 8 channels this would be 128). Channel# implies a different method of coding in which an event in a given channel is assigned the channel number as value."
